#
# Bandits never appear in the room feed, so bigshot hunts them by scraping
# a manual LOOK and manufacturing the quarry with GameObj.new_npc
# (bandit_track 9459), one last look before leaving each room (bs_wander
# 9375). Bandit mode also relaxes the rules that would otherwise stop a
# bandit fight: the target list is the bandit nouns on the quick routine
# (sort_npcs 8622), priority never switches, should_flee? answers
# no past always_flee_from and the ambusher hook is off.
# It is turned on by ";bigshot bounty" when the bounty says "suppress
# bandit activity" (set_bounty_eval 3824, 3357) and by nothing else.
#
# Rangers TRACK toward a named creature when off cooldown before every
# wander step (ranger_track 9488): a trail moves us and we stay; "You
# don't have to go far" means it is hidden here, so we stay when the room
# is ours and move when it is not; anything else moves on. A room with
# nothing hostile showing gets an UNCOVER: 609 open for a Ranger
# with it, else SEARCH. The creature is the script's free argument
# (";bigshot single giant rat", 3331).
#
# Here: Tracking::Policy from the script's options and the bounty text,
# Actions::Track, Actions::Uncover, and Wander takes
# the policy. Rules and line references in hunting-engine-plan.md,
# "Bandits and tracking".
