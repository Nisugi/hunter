# ============================================================================

#
# ecleanse is a main loop that reads the character's afflictions
# and the room's hazards every 0.2 s into an event stack, a DownstreamHook
# (1618) that queues the line-driven ones (disarms, the sanctum transform,
# the infected wound, weapon webbing, hive traps, the itchy curse, the
# entangling bind), and one Action per event that pauses every other
# script while it works (System.scripts_pause). The engine's Cleanse is
# that as the behavior at priority 5: wants_control? is the condition
# list, the Watch carries the line rules, and taking the tick IS the
# pause. Each ecleanse Action is an engine Action with the same gates and
# the same commands, bounded where ecleanse loops. Settings come from
# ecleanse.yaml (its setup window stays where it is). Rules and ecleanse
# line references in hunting-engine-plan.md, "Cleanse".
#
